   What I have done to create a merge conflict 

   a) Created a branch named demo 
   b) Created a txt file in demo branch and edited that txt file with some content. 
   c) Then created  a new branch named demo1 .
   d) Edited the same txt file in branch demo1 and make a commit in demo1 . 
   e) Now checkout to demo branch and edit the same txt file and make a commit in demo .
   f) Now while merging demo1 to demo we face a conflict .

   This conflict is resolved by me in following steps 

   a) Opened the txt file with vim editor.
   b) Then make the nessasary changes and select which file 
        we have to commit and remove conflict maker.
   c) Now add the file and make a commit .
   d) By doing this my merge conflict is resolved and branches are merged succesfully.
